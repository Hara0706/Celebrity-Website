        <h1>IPL CAREER</h1>
        <h2>Royal Challengers Bangalore</h2>
        <p>
            Following the Under-19 World Cup, Kohli was bought by the franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for $30,000 on a youth
            contract. He was the captain of Royal challengers Bangalore for 15 seasons but could not win a
            trophy. In the 2010 season, Kohli was the third highest run-getter for his team with 307 runs, averaging 27.90 and improving his
            strike rate to 144.81. During 2013 season, Kohli averaged 45.28 and hit a total of 634 runs at a strike rate of over 138 including six fifties
            and a top-score of 99 and finished as the season's third-highest run-scorer.
            <br>
            At the 2016 IPL, the Royal Challengers finished runners-up and Kohli broke the record for most runs in an IPL season (of
            733 runs) by scoring 973 runs in 16 matches at an average of 81.08, winning the Orange Cap as well as Most-valuable
            Player Award of Vivo IPL 2016. He scored four centuries in the tournament, having never scored one in the
            Twenty20 format before the start of the season, and also became the first player to reach the 4000-run milestone in the
            IPL. At the launch event of his biography, 'Driven: The Virat Kohli Story' in New Delhi, in October 2016, Kohli
            announced that RCB would be the IPL franchise that he would permanently play for.
            <br>
            On 22 April 2021, against Rajasthan Royals, Kohli became the first ever player to reach 6000 IPL Runs. On 20
            September, Royal Challengers Bangalore announced that Kohli would step down as captain following the 2021 IPL season.
