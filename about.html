            Kohli was raised in Uttam Nagar and started his schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School. In 1998, the West
            Delhi Cricket Academy was created and a nine-year-old Kohli was part of its first intake. Kohli trained at the
            academy under Rajkumar Sharma and also played matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy at Vasundhara Enclave at the same
            time. In ninth grade, he shifted to Saviour Convent in Paschim Vihar to help his cricket practice. His

            semi-final against Bangladesh, Kohli scored 96*, thus becoming the fastest batsman, in terms of innings, to reach 8,000

            New Zealand, in which Kohli was out for just a run.

            In June 2021, India lost the 2021 ICC World Test Championship Final to New Zealand. This was Kohli's third

            "Virushka". Their relationship attracted substantial media attention, with persistent rumours and speculations
            in the media, as neither of the two publicly talked about it. The couple married on 11 December 2017 in a private
            ceremony in Florence, Italy. On 11 January 2021, they became parents to a baby girl, Vamika.
